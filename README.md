# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java implementations of various data structures and sorting algorithms. The code included here is the result of my work in the Data Structures PAO II course in 2021 and the Algorithms Analysis PAO I course in 2022.

Whether you're a student studying data structures and algorithms or a developer looking to improve your programming skills, this repository is a valuable resource. You can explore the code, learn from it, and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
